Compile :
edit Makefile :( for setup path to tcl library and includes

Usage:

load sniplet.so
    load "sniplet" library.
    if u want to use "package require" interface, u should
    follows by instuction from official sites about how to create it.

this library provide 2 commands: "sniplet" and "lazy":

sniplet ?arglist code
    Invoke independed code-block with argument. Like proc,
    but it executed just in-place, w/o any namespace modifying.

lazy ?arglist code
    Invoke independed code-block with argument in moment when
    result is needed. If U don`t ask for result, execution being omitted.

"arglist" are list of varnames for pass into code-block by values
"code" is single command or script enclosed into {}

any other features may implements in tcl script via "sniplet","lazy"
and standart commands ("apply" "foreach" in first order)

ToDo:
- improve Makefile for independed from tcl location and version
- create tcl package for loading "sniplet" extesion via "package require"
- modify code for execute sniplet in level #0 (now it executed in current level)
- add support for volatile-length args and "info arguments"

Sorry:
- in current Tcl state, "lazy" and other modern functionality
is too hard for coding.(on older tcl-version this tricks being much
simple and short, when implemented via language internals).
- code is deep-experimental and contains trace and debug invokes
- !! english is not my native or prefered language !! :)
